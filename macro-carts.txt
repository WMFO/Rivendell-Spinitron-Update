Automation is controlled using these two Macro CARTS. Of note with regards to
the Spinitron logger is the on-air flag, which has been appropriated to be the
automation is off flag. This affects the pm used by the logger.

Automation ON
001  PM 2!
002  TA 0!
003  RN /usr/bin/playlist.sh!

This sets the mode to automatic (instead of manual or liveassist),
sets the on-air flag to 0,
and executes this shell script:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/rmlsend LL\ 1\ Failsafe\!
/usr/local/bin/rmlsend LL\ 1\ `date +%Y_%m_%d`\!

This loads the failsafe log, and if today's log exists, overwrites it with that.
These logs are generated by a separate script.

Automation OFF
001  TA 1!
002  LL 1 BLANK!
003  LL 2 BLANK!
004  LL 3 BLANK!

This sets the on-air flag to 1, and removes all logs.
